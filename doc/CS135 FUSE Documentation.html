<h1>CS135 FUSE Documentation</h1>

<p>
There very little FUSE documentation on the <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/">FUSE Web site.</a> A bit more,
which is unfortunately very outdated, is available from <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-fuse/">an IBM
article from 2006</a>.  If you come across anything more complete or
more current, I'd appreciate hearing about it so I can add a link to
it from this site.

</p><h2> Writing a FUSE Client</h2>

The best way to write a fuse client is to start with an example or an
existing client; I recommend <code>fusexmp.c</code> or
<code>fusexmp_fh.c</code> (the latter implements file handles, so it's
a better choice if you're developing a complex filesystem).  The
existing clients provide a scaffolding for you to work from, but
you'll still need to understand <a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#function-purposes">what all
the functions are supposed to do</a>, and also how to <a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#compiling">compile</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#running">run</a> your
client.  That's what this Web page is for.

<h3>Unix Manual Pages</h3>

<p>
May of the FUSE functions are closely related to Unix system calls.
Rather than repeating the full specification (especially error
conditions) here, it's better for you to refer to the Unix man page.
You can do this on any Unix machine with the "man" command.  By
convention, if I refer you to the "stat(2) system call", that means
you should type "man 2 stat" to get the necessary information.

</p><h3>FUSE File Handles</h3>

<p>
Many FUSE functions offer two ways to identify the file being operated
upon.  The first, which is always available, is the
"<code>path</code>" argument, which is the full pathname (relative to
the filesystem root) of the file in question.  If you choose to do so,
all your functions can use that argument to locate a file.

</p><p>
However, pathname lookup is often a very expensive operation, so FUSE
sometimes provides you another option: a "file handle" in the
"<code>fuse_file_info</code>" structure.  The file handle is stored in
the "<code>fh</code>" element of that structure, which is an unsigned
64-bit integer (<code>uint64_t</code>) uninterpreted by FUSE.  If you
choose to use it, you should set that field in your
<code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#open">open</a></code>,
<code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#create">create</a></code>, and
<code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/opendir">opendir</a></code> functions; other
functions can then use it.  In many FUSE implementations, the file
handle is actually a pointer to a useful data structure, which is
typecast to an integer to keep the compiler happy.  But you can make
it an index into an array, a hash key, or pretty much anything else
you choose.

</p><h3>Getting FUSE Context</h3>

<p>
For many operations, it is useful to have a relevant "context" in
which to execute them.  For historical reasons, the context isn't
passed as an argument; instead you must call
<code>fuse_get_context</code> with no argument, which returns a
pointer to a <code>struct fuse_context</code> with the following
usable elements:

</p><dl>
    <dt> <code>uid</code>
	</dt><dd> The (numeric) user ID of the process invoking the operation.
    </dd><dt> <code>gid</code>
	</dt><dd> The (numeric) group ID of the process invoking the operation.
    </dd><dt> <code>pid</code>
	</dt><dd> The thread (process) ID of the process invoking the operation.
    </dd><dt> <code>private_data</code>
	</dt><dd> A pointer (<code>void*</code>) to the private data
	    returned by the <code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#init">init</a></code> function.
    </dd><dt> <code>umask</code>
	</dt><dd> The <code>umask</code> of the process invoking the operation.
</dd></dl>

<h3><a name="function-purposes">FUSE Functions</a></h3>

<p>
The following is a brief description of all the API functions you can
create in a FUSE filesystem.  Note that many are unnecessary,
especially if you are implementing a partial filesystem like the one
in this assignment.  However, I have tried to provide full
documentation here.  Unless otherwise specified, all functions return
an integer 0 or a positive number for
success, or a negative value selected from <code>errno.h</code> if
there is an error.

</p><p>
All of your functions should be named with a prefix that is closely
related to your filesystem name.  For example, in an SSH filesystem
you should use <code>ssh_getattr</code>, <code>ssh_read</code>, etc.

</p><dl>
    <dt> <code>void* <a name="init">init</a>(struct fuse_conn_info *conn)</code>
	</dt><dd> Initialize the filesystem.  This function can often be
	    left unimplemented, but it can be a handy way to perform
	    one-time setup such as allocating variable-sized data
	    structures or initializing a new filesystem.
	    The
	    <code>fuse_conn_info</code> structure gives information
	    about what features are supported by FUSE, and can be used
	    to request certain capabilities (see
	    <a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#init-args">below</a> for more information).
	    The return value of this function is available to all file
	    operations in the <code>private_data</code> field of
	    <code><a name="fuse_conntext">fuse_context</a></code>.  It
	    is also passed as a parameter to the destroy() method.
    </dd><dt> <code>void <a name="destroy">destroy</a>(void* private_data)</code>
	</dt><dd> Called when the filesystem exits.  The
	    <code>private_data</code> comes from the return value of
	    <code>init</code>.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="getattr">getattr</a>(const char* path, struct
	    stat* stbuf)</code>
	</dt><dd> Return file attributes.  The "stat" structure is
	    described in detail in the stat(2) manual page.  For the
	    given pathname, this should fill in the elements of the
	    "stat" structure.  If a field is meaningless or
	    semi-meaningless (e.g., <code>st_ino</code>) then it
	    should be set to 0 or given a "reasonable" value.  This
	    call is pretty much required for a usable filesystem.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="fgetattr">fgetattr</a>(const char* path, struct
	    stat* stbuf)</code>
	</dt><dd> As <code>getattr</code>, but called when fgetattr(2) is
	    invoked by the user program.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="access">access</a>(const char* path, mask)</code>
	</dt><dd> This is the same as the access(2) system call.  It returns
	    -ENOENT if the <code>path</code> doesn't exist, -EACCESS
	    if the requested permission isn't available, or 0 for
	    success.  Note that it can be called on files,
	    directories, or any other object that appears in the
	    filesystem.  This call is not required but is highly
	    recommended.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="readlink">readlink</a>(const char* path, char*
	    buf, size_t size)</code>
	</dt><dd> If <code>path</code> is a symbolic link, fill
	    <code>buf</code> with its target, up to
	    <code>size</code>.  See readlink(2) for how to handle a
	    too-small buffer and for error codes.  Not required if you
	    don't support symbolic links.
	    <strong>NOTE:</strong> Symbolic-link support requires only
	    <code>readlink</code> and <code>symlink</code>.  FUSE
	    itself will take care of tracking symbolic links in paths,
	    so your path-evaluation code doesn't need to worry about it.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="opendir">opendir</a>(const char* path, struct
	    fuse_file_info* fi)</code>
	</dt><dd> Open a directory for reading.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="readdir">readdir</a>(const char* path, void*
	    buf, fuse_fill_dir_t filler, off_t offset, struct
	    fuse_file_info* fi)</code>
	</dt><dd> Return one or more directory entries (<code>struct
	    dirent</code>) to the caller.  This is one of the most
	    complex FUSE functions.  It is related to, but not
	    identical to, the readdir(2) and getdents(2) system calls,
	    and the readdir(3) library function.  Because of its
	    complexity, it is described separately <a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#readdir-details">below</a>.  Required for essentially any
	    filesystem, since it's what makes
	    <code>ls</code> and a whole bunch of other things work.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="mknod">mknod</a>(const char* path, mode_t
	    mode, dev_t rdev)</code>
	</dt><dd> Make a special (device) file, FIFO, or socket.  See
	    mknod(2) for details.  This function is rarely needed,
	    since it's uncommon to make these objects inside
	    special-purpose filesystems.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="mkdir">mkdir</a>(const char* path, mode_t mode)</code>
	</dt><dd> Create a directory with the given name.  The directory
	    permissions are encoded in <code>mode</code>.  See
	    mkdir(2) for details.  This function is needed for any
	    reasonable read/write filesystem.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="unlink">unlink</a>(const char* path)</code>
	</dt><dd> Remove (delete) the given file, symbolic link, hard link,
	    or special node.  Note that if you support hard links,
	    <code>unlink</code> only deletes the data when the
	    <em>last</em> hard link is removed.  See unlink(2) for
	    details.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="rmdir">rmdir</a>(const char* path)</code>
	</dt><dd> Remove the given directory.  This should succeed only if
	    the directory is empty (except for "." and "..").  See
	    rmdir(2) for details.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="symlink">symlink</a>(const char* to, const
	    char* from)</code>
	</dt><dd> Create a symbolic link named "<code>from</code>" which,
	    when evaluated, will lead to "<code>to</code>".  Not
	    required if you don't support symbolic links.
	    <strong>NOTE:</strong> Symbolic-link support requires only
	    <code>readlink</code> and <code>symlink</code>.  FUSE
	    itself will take care of tracking symbolic links in paths,
	    so your path-evaluation code doesn't need to worry about it.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="rename">rename</a>(const char* from, const
	    char* to)</code>
	</dt><dd> Rename the file, directory, or other object
	    "<code>from</code>" to the target "<code>to</code>".  Note
	    that the source and target don't have to be in the same
	    directory, so it may be necessary to move the source to an
	    entirely new directory.  See rename(2) for full details.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="link">link</a>(const char* from, const char*
	    to)</code>
	</dt><dd> Create a hard link between "<code>from</code>" and
	    "<code>to</code>".  Hard links aren't required for a
	    working filesystem, and many successful filesystems don't
	    support them.  If you <em>do</em> implement hard links, be
	    aware that they have an effect on how <code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#unlink">unlink</a></code> works.  See
	    <code>link(2)</code> for details.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="chmod">chmod</a>(const char* path, mode_t mode)</code>
	</dt><dd> Change the mode (permissions) of the given object to the
	    given new permissions.  Only the permissions bits of
	    <code>mode</code> should be examined.  See chmod(2) for
	    details.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="chown">chown</a>(const char* path, uid_t uid,
	    gid_t gid</code>
	</dt><dd> Change the given object's owner and group to the provided
	    values.  See chown(2) for details.  <strong>NOTE:</strong>
	    FUSE doesn't deal particularly well with file ownership,
	    since it usually runs as an unprivileged user and this call
	    is restricted to the superuser.  It's often easier to
	    pretend that all files are owned by the user who mounted
	    the filesystem, and to skip implementing this function.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="truncate">truncate</a>(const char* path, off_t size)</code>
	</dt><dd> Truncate or extend the given file so that it is precisely
	    <code>size</code> bytes long.  See truncate(2) for
	    details.  This call is required for read/write
	    filesystems, because recreating a file will first truncate
	    it.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="ftruncate">ftruncate</a>(const char* path,
	    off_t size)</code>
	</dt><dd> As <code>truncate</code>, but called when ftruncate(2) is
	    called by the user program.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="utimens">utimens</a>(const char* path, const
	    struct timespec ts[2]</code>
	</dt><dd> Update the last access time of the given object from
	    ts[0] and the last modification time from ts[1].  Both
	    time specifications are given to nanosecond resolution,
	    but your filesystem doesn't have to be that precise; see
	    utimensat(2) for full details.  Note that the time
	    specifications are allowed to have certain special values;
	    however, I don't know if FUSE functions have to support
	    them.  This function isn't necessary but is nice to have
	    in a fully functional filesystem.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="open">open</a>(const char* path, struct
	    fuse_file_info* fi)</code>
	</dt><dd> Open a file.  If you aren't using file handles, this
	    function should just check for existence and permissions
	    and return either success or an error code.  If you use
	    file handles, you should also allocate any necessary
	    structures and set <code>fi-&gt;fh</code>.  In addition,
	    <code>fi</code> has some other fields that an advanced
	    filesystem might find useful; see the structure definition in
	    <code>fuse_common.h</code> for very brief commentary.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="read">read</a>(const char* path, char *buf,
	    size_t size, off_t offset, struct fuse_file_info* fi)</code>
	</dt><dd> Read <code>size</code>bytes from the given file into the
	    buffer <code>buf</code>, beginning <code>offset</code>
	    bytes into the file.  See read(2) for full details.
	    Returns the number of bytes transferred, or 0 if
	    <code>offset</code> was at or beyond the end of the file.
	    Required for any sensible filesystem.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="write">write</a>(const char* path, char *buf,
	    size_t size, off_t offset, struct fuse_file_info* fi)</code>
	</dt><dd> As for <code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#read">read</a></code> above,
	    except that it can't return 0.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="statfs">statfs</a>(const char* path, struct
	    statvfs* stbuf</code>
	</dt><dd> Return statistics about the filesystem.  See statvfs(2)
	    for a description of the structure contents.  Usually, you
	    can ignore the <code>path</code>.  Not required, but handy
	    for read/write filesystems since this is how programs like
	    <code>df</code> determine the free space.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="release">release</a>(const char* path, struct
	    fuse_file_info *fi)</code>
	</dt><dd> This is the only FUSE function that doesn't have a
	    directly corresponding system call, although close(2)
	    is related.  <code>Release</code> is called when FUSE is
	    completely done with a file; at that point, you can free
	    up any temporarily allocated data structures.  The IBM
	    document claims that there is exactly one
	    <code>release</code> per <code>open</code>, but I don't
	    know if that is true.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="releasedir">releasedir</a>(const char* path,
	    struct fuse_file_info *fi)</code>
	</dt><dd> This is like <code>release</code>, except for directories.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="fsync">fsync</a>(const char* path, int
	    isdatasync, struct fuse_file_info* fi)</code>
	</dt><dd> Flush any dirty information about the file to disk.  If
	    <code>isdatasync</code> is nonzero, only data, not
	    metadata, needs to be flushed.  When this call returns,
	    all file data should be on stable storage.  Many
	    filesystems leave this call unimplemented, although
	    technically that's a Bad Thing since it risks losing data.
	    If you store your filesystem inside a plain file on
	    another filesystem, you can implement this by calling
	    fsync(2) on that file, which will flush too much data
	    (slowing performance) but achieve the desired guarantee.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="fsyncdir">fsyncdir</a>(const char* path, int
	    isdatasync, struct fuse_file_info* fi)</code>
	</dt><dd> Like <code>fsync</code>, but for directories.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="flush">flush</a>(const char* path, struct
	    fuse_file_info* fi)</code>
	</dt><dd> Called on each close so that the filesystem has a chance
	    to report delayed errors.  <strong>Important:</strong>
	    there may be more than one <code>flush</code> call for
	    each <code>open</code>.  <strong>Note:</strong> There is
	    no guarantee that <code>flush</code> will ever be called
	    at all!
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="lock">lock</a>(const char* path, struct
	    fuse_file_info* fi, int cmd, struct flock* locks)</code>
	</dt><dd> Perform a POSIX file-locking operation.  See details <a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#locking-details">below.</a>
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="bmap">bmap</a>(const char* path, size_t blocksize,
	    uint64_t* blockno)</code>
	</dt><dd> This function is similar to bmap(9).  If the filesystem
	    is backed by a block device, it converts
	    <code>blockno</code> from a file-relative block number to
	    a device-relative block.  It isn't entirely clear how the
	    <code>blocksize</code> parameter is intended to be used.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="setxattr">setxattr</a>(const char* path, const
	    char* name, const char* value, size_t size, int flags)</code>
	</dt><dd> Set an extended attribute.  See setxattr(2).  This should
	    be implemented only if <code>HAVE_SETXATTR</code> is true.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="getxattr">getxattr</a>(const char* path, const
	    char* name, char* value, size_t size)</code>
	</dt><dd> Read an extended attribute.  See getxattr(2).  This should
	    be implemented only if <code>HAVE_SETXATTR</code> is true.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="listxattr">listxattr</a>(const char* path,
	    const char* list, size_t size)</code>
	</dt><dd> List the names of all extended attributes.  See
	    listxattr(2).  This should be implemented only if
	    <code>HAVE_SETXATTR</code> is true.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="ioctl">ioctl</a>(const char* path, int cmd,
	    void* arg, struct fuse_file_info* fi, unsigned int flags,
	    void* data</code>
	</dt><dd> Support the ioctl(2) system call.  As such, almost
	    everything is up to the filesystem.  On a 64-bit machine,
	    <code>FUSE_IOCTL_COMPAT</code> will be set for 32-bit ioctls.
	    The size and direction of data is determined by
	    <code>_IOC_*()</code> decoding of <code>cmd</code>.  For
	    <code>_IOC_NONE</code>, <code>data</code> will be
	    <code>NULL</code>; for <code>_IOC_WRITE</code>
	    <code>data</code> is being written by the user; for
	    <code>_IOC_READ</code> it is being read, and if both are
	    set the data is bidirectional.  In all non-NULL cases, the
	    area is <code>_IOC_SIZE(cmd)</code> bytes in size.
    </dd><dt> <code><a name="poll">poll</a>(const char* path, struct
	    fuse_file_info* fi, struct fuse_pollhandle* ph, unsigned*
	    reventsp);</code>
	</dt><dd> Poll for I/O readiness.  If <code>ph</code> is non-NULL,
	    when the filesystem is ready for I/O it should call
	    <code>fuse_notify_poll</code> (possibly asynchronously)
	    with the specified <code>ph</code>; this will clear all
	    pending <code>poll</code>s.  The callee is responsible for
	    destroying <code>ph</code> with
	    <code>fuse_pollhandle_destroy()</code> when
	    <code>ph</code> is no longer needed.
</dd></dl>

<h4><a name="init-args">Init Function</a></h4>

<p>
The initialization function accepts a <code>fuse_conn_info</code>
structure, which can be used to investigate and control the system's
capabilities.  The components of this structure are:
</p><dl>
    <dt> <code>proto_major</code> and <code>proto_minor</code>
	</dt><dd> Major and minor versions of the FUSE protocol
	    (read-only).
    </dd><dt> <code>async_read</code>
	</dt><dd> On entry, this is nonzero if asynchronous
	    reads are supported.  The initialization
	    function can modify this as desired.  Note
	    that this field is duplicated by the
	    <code>FUSE_CAP_ASYNC_READ</code> flag;
	    asynchronous reads are controlled by the
	    logical OR of the field and the flag.  (Yes,
	    this is a silly hangover from the past.)
    </dd><dt> <code>max_write</code>
	</dt><dd> The maximum size of a write buffer.  This can be modified
	    by the init function.  If it is set to less than 4096, it
	    is increased to that value.
    </dd><dt> <code>max_readahead</code>
	</dt><dd> The maximum readahead size.  This can be modified by the
	    init function.
    </dd><dt> <code>capable</code>
	</dt><dd> The capabilities supported by the FUSE kernel module,
	    encoded as bit flags (read-only).
    </dd><dt> <code>want</code>
	</dt><dd> The capabilities desired by the FUSE client, encoded as
	    bit flags.
</dd></dl>

<p>
The capabilities that can be requested are:
</p><dl>
    <dt> <code>FUSE_CAP_ASYNC_READ</code>
	</dt><dd> Use asynchronous reads (default).  To disable this
	    option, the client must clear both this capability (in the
	    <code>want</code> flags) and the <code>async_read</code>
	    field.  If synchronous reads are chosen, Fuse will wait
	    for reads to complete before issuing any other requests.
    </dd><dt> <code>FUSE_CAP_POSIX_LOCKS</code>
	</dt><dd> Set if the client supports "remote" locking via the
	    <code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#lock">lock</a></code> call.
    </dd><dt> <code>FUSE_CAP_ATOMIC_O_TRUNC</code>
	</dt><dd> Set if the filesystem supports the <code>O_TRUNC</code>
	    open flag.
    </dd><dt> <code>FUSE_CAP_EXPORT_SUPPORT</code>

<h4><a name="readdir-details">Readdir Function</a></h4>

<p>
The <code>readdir</code> function is somewhat like <code>read</code>,
in that it starts at a given offset and returns results in a
caller-supplied buffer.  However, the offset not a byte offset, and
the results are a series of <code>struct dirent</code>s rather than
being uninterpreted bytes.  To make life easier, FUSE provides a
"filler" function that will help you put things into the buffer.

</p><p>
The general plan for a complete and correct <code>readdir</code> is:
</p><ol>
    <li> Find the first directory entry following the given <code>offset</code>
	(see below).
    </li><li> Optionally, create a <code>struct stat</code> that describes
	the file as for <code>getattr</code> (but FUSE only looks at
	<code>st_ino</code> and the file-type bits of
	<code>st_mode</code>).
    </li><li> Call the <code>filler</code> function with arguments of
	<code>buf</code>, the null-terminated filename, the address of
	your <code>struct stat</code> (or NULL if you have none), and
	the offset of the <em>next</em> directory entry.
    </li><li> If <code>filler</code> returns nonzero, or if there are no
	more files, return 0.
    </li><li> Find the next file in the directory.
    </li><li> Go back to step 2.
</li></ol>

<p>
From FUSE's point of view, the <code>offset</code> is an uninterpreted
<code>off_t</code> (i.e., an unsigned integer).  You provide an offset
when you call <code>filler</code>, and it's possible that such an
offset might come back to you as an argument later.  Typically, it's
simply the byte offset (within your directory layout) of the directory
entry, but it's really up to you.

</p><p>
It's also important to note that <code>readdir</code> can return
errors in a number of instances; in particular it can return -EBADF if
the file handle is invalid, or -ENOENT if you use the
<code>path</code> argument and the path doesn't exist.

</p><h4><a name="locking-details">Lock function</a></h4>

<p>
The <code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#lock">lock</a></code> function is somewhat
complex.  The <code>cmd</code> will be one of <code>F_GETLK</code>,
<code>F_SETLK</code>, or <code>F_SETLKW</code>.  The fields in
<code>locks</code> are defined in the fcntl(2) manual page; the
<code>l_whence</code> field in that structure will always be
<code>SEEK_SET</code>.

</p><p>
For checking lock ownership, the <code>fi-&gt;owner</code> argument must
be used.

<!--
<P>
For <CODE>F_GETLK</CODE> operation, the FUSE library will first check
currently held locks, and if a conflicting lock is found it will
return information without calling this method.  This is intended to
ensure that for local locks the <CODE>l_pid</CODE> field is correctly
filled in.  The results may not be accurate in case of race conditions
and in the presence of hard links, but according to comments in the
code, "it's unlikly that an application would rely on accurate
<CODE>GETLK</CODE> results in these cases."  Um, yeah.

<P>
If a conflicting lock is not found, the <CODE><A
HREF="#lock">lock</A></CODE> method will be called, and the filesystem
may fill in <CODE>l_pid</CODE> with a meaningful value, or it may
leave this field zero.
         
<P>
For <CODE>F_SETLK</CODE> and <CODE>F_SETLKW</CODE> the
<CODE>l_pid</CODE> field will be set to the PID of the process
performing the locking operation.
         
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> if this method is not implemented, the kernel
will still allow file locking to work locally.  Hence it is only
necessary in situations such as network filesystems, where other
machines may be simultaneously accessing the files.
-->

</p><p>
Contrary to what some other documentation states, the FUSE library
does not appear to do anything special to help you out with locking.
If you want locking to work, you will need to implement the lock
function.  (Persons who have more knowledge of how FUSE locking works
are encouraged to contact me on this topic, since the existing
documentation appears to be inaccurate.)

</p><h3>The Rest of a FUSE Client</h3>

<p>
Once you've written your operations, you need some boilerplate.
As mentioned above, all of your functions should be named with a
sensible prefix; here I use "<code>prefix</code>" to represent that.
Create a <code>fuse_operations</code> struct that lists the functions
you implemented (for any unimplemented ones, simply delete the
relevant lines):

</p><pre>static struct fuse_operations prefix_oper = {
    .init        = prefix_init,
    .destroy     = prefix_destroy,
    .getattr     = prefix_getattr,
    .fgetattr    = prefix_fgetattr,
    .access      = prefix_access,
    .readlink    = prefix_readlink,
    .readdir     = prefix_readdir,
    .mknod       = prefix_mknod,
    .mkdir       = prefix_mkdir,
    .symlink     = prefix_symlink,
    .unlink      = prefix_unlink,
    .rmdir       = prefix_rmdir,
    .rename      = prefix_rename,
    .link        = prefix_link,
    .chmod       = prefix_chmod,
    .chown       = prefix_chown,
    .truncate    = prefix_truncate,
    .ftruncate   = prefix_ftruncate,
    .utimens     = prefix_utimens,
    .create      = prefix_create,
    .open        = prefix_open,
    .read        = prefix_read,
    .write       = prefix_write,
    .statfs      = prefix_statfs,
    .release     = prefix_release,
    .opendir     = prefix_opendir,
    .releasedir  = prefix_releasedir,
    .fsync       = prefix_fsync,
    .flush       = prefix_flush,
    .fsyncdir    = prefix_fsyncdir,
    .lock        = prefix_lock,
    .bmap        = prefix_bmap,
    .ioctl       = prefix_ioctl,
    .poll        = prefix_poll,
#ifdef HAVE_SETXATTR
    .setxattr    = prefix_setxattr,
    .getxattr    = prefix_getxattr,
    .listxattr   = prefix_listxattr,
    .removexattr = prefix_removexattr,
#endif
    .flag_nullpath_ok = 0,                /* See below */
};
</pre>

<p>
Set <code>flag_nullpath_ok</code> nonzero if your code can accept a
NULL path argument (because it gets file information from
<code>fi-&gt;fh</code>) for the following operations:
<code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#fgetattr">fgetattr</a></code>,
<code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#flush">flush</a></code>,
<code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#fsync">fsync</a></code>,
<code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#fsyncdir">fsyncdir</a></code>,
<code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#ftruncate">ftruncate</a></code>,
<code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#lock">lock</a></code>,
<code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#read">read</a></code>,
<code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#readdir">readdir</a></code>,
<code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#release">release</a></code>,
<code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#releasedir">releasedir</a></code>, and
<code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#write">write</a></code>.
This will allow FUSE to run more efficiently.

</p><p>
Finally, since your client is actually an executable program, you need
a <code>main</code>:

</p><pre>int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    umask(0);
    return fuse_main(argc, argv, &amp;prefix_oper, NULL);
}
</pre>

<h2><a name="compiling">Compiling Your Program</a></h2>

<p>
You can do your development on any machine you choose that supports
FUSE.  Mac users can try <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/">macfuse</a>; Linux users
should be able to find FUSE as part of their distribution.

</p><p>
Compiling a FUSE program requires a slightly complicated command:
</p><pre>/usr/bin/gcc -g `pkg-config fuse --cflags --libs` my_hello.c -o my_hello
</pre>

A better approach, of course, is to use <code>make</code>.  This truly
minimal <code><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/Makefile">Makefile</a></code> will let you type
"<code>make foo</code>" for any <code>foo.c</code>.  You are
encouraged to use it and extend it to be more sensible.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> On Wilkes, be sure to use "/usr/bin/gcc" rather
than just "gcc".  Wilkes is specially configured so that plain gcc
produces 32-bit code, but for this assignment you need 64-bit code.

<h2><a name="running">Running &amp; Testing</a></h2>

<p>
To run a FUSE program, you'll need two windows and a scratch
directory.  You'll run your filesystem under a debugger in
window #1; window #2 will be used for testing.  The scratch directory
is needed because you must have an empty directory on which to mount
your shiny new filesystem.

</p><p>
The simplest (and incorrect, for our purposes) way to run a FUSE
program is to make a scratch directory and then pass that as an
argument to the program.  For example, if you're running the "hello,
world" filesystem (<code>hello.c</code>):
</p><pre>$ mkdir testdir
$ ./hello testdir
$ ls testdir
hello
$ cat testdir/hello
hello, world
$ fusermount -u testdir
$ rmdir testdir
</pre>

<p>
When you run your program this way, it automatically goes into the
background and starts serving up your filesystem.  After you finish
testing, the <code>fusermount</code> command unmounts your filesystem
and kills the background program.

</p><p>
As a practical matter, it's easier to leave <code>testdir</code>
hanging around rather than making it and removing it every time.  Most
systems have a number of empty directories hanging around just in case
you want to mount on top of them (often, either <code>/mnt</code> or
inside <code>/mnt</code>).

</p><p>
Of course, it's unlikely that your program will work perfectly the
first time, so it's better to run it under the debugger.  To do that,
you'll need two windows.  In window #1, do:
</p><pre>$ mkdir testdir         # if necessary
$ gdb hello
[gdb noise]
(gdb) [set breakpoints, etc.]
(gdb) run -s -d testdir
</pre>

<p>
The <code>-s</code> switch means "single-threaded", which makes gdb
behave in a much friendlier fashion.  The <code>-d</code> switch means
"debug"; in addition to printing helpful debugging output, it keeps
the program in the foreground so gdb won't lose track of it.

</p><p>
Now, in window #2 you can do:
</p><pre>$ ls testdir
...                    # Other trial commands
$ fusermount -u testdir
</pre>

<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You need to do the <code>fusermount</code>
even if your program crashes or you abort it.

</p><p>
If you have set breakpoints, when you do "ls testdir", your window may
seem to hang.  That's OK; just go over to the gdb window and step
through your code.  When it returns a result, your test window will
come alive again.

</p><h3>Other Options</h3>

<p>
Your new FUSE client has a lot of options.  The simplest invocation
just specifies a mount point.  For example, if your client is named
<code>fuse_client</code> and you're mounting on "~/foo", use:
</p><pre>./fuse_client ~/foo
</pre>

<p>
There are tons of switches available; use <code>./fuse_client
-h</code> to see them all.  The important ones are:

</p><dl>
    <dt> -d
	</dt><dd> Enable debugging output (implies -f).
    </dd><dt> -f
	</dt><dd> Run in foreground; this is useful if you're running under
	    a debugger.  <strong>WARNING:</strong> When -f is given,
	    Fuse's working directory is the directory you were in when
	    you started it.  Without -f, Fuse changes directories to
	    "/".  This will screw you up if you use relative
	    pathnames.
    </dd><dt> -s
	</dt><dd> Run single-threaded instead of multi-threaded.  This
	    makes debugging vastly easier, since gdb doesn't handle
	    multiple threads all that well.  It also protects you from
	    all sorts of race conditions.  Unless you're trying to
	    write a production filesystem <em>and</em> you're a
	    parallelism expert, I recommend that you <em>always</em>
	    use this switch.
    </dd><dt> -o [no]rellinks
	</dt><dd> Transform absolute symlinks to relative (or don't, if
	    <code>norellinks</code> is given).
</dd></dl>

Contrary to what the help implies, switches can be specified before
the mount point, in standard Unix fashion.
